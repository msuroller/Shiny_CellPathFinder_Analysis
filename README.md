# Shiny_CellPathFinder_Analysis
Shiny App for cellpathfinder cell_stats file input, outputs graphs, control-normalized graphs, and hopefully background subtracted/control-normalized graphs.

It works decently well.

To Do List:
  - Add error catches so it tells the user what's wrong instead of just closing the program.
  - Test with a different file
  - Add background sub calculations
  - Add background sub graphs tabBox
  - Make a button to download the graphs and the end data file.
  - Figure out how to change starting values like in Computational Physics
  - Figure out how to compute significance and display it on the graphs
  - Make inputs for the stains used and automate titles with it
